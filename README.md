# Orbital Mechanics: Fall 2020 
**Code for Projects 2 and 3** 

## Project 2

**Main Code**
* Trajectory of an elliptical orbit was determined using Lambert's Theorem 
* Comparisons were made with the given orbital properties to ensure correctness 
* Time of Flight (TOF) as well as observation angles were determined 

Source code developed in MATLAB Coding language. Main features include a 
```
for loop
```
for observations of time of flght vs. semimajor axis length 'a' and a 
```
while loop
```
for indicating the maximum TOF for the orbit 

**Plotting** 

Plots are developed within MATLAB to show the oribit trajectories. Main elements include
modifications to the 
```
LineWidth 
Color 
AxesOrigin
Viscircles 
```
operations in MATLAB to display clear and concise orbital trajectories in relation to the Earth 




## Project 3 

*Code currently in development. Please check back at a later date*
